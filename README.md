# Computer Vision Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates basic image loading and displaying functionality using the OpenCV library. The `images.py` script loads images from the `Images` folder and displays them in separate windows.

## `images.py` Script

The `images.py` script performs the following tasks:

1. **Load an Image**: The script reads an image file from the specified path.
2. **Display the Image**: It displays the loaded image in a window using OpenCV.
3. **Error Handling**: If the image cannot be loaded (e.g., if the file path is incorrect or the file does not exist), an error message is printed to the console.
